# Permuta

The project aims to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for hostel residents to engage in peer-to-peer transactions within their community. By facilitating the buying and selling of items, we aim to foster a sustainable and collaborative culture within the hostels while promoting reuse and reducing waste.
